1. 1940- Bell Telephone laboratories to complete this calculator  designed by scientist George Stibitz. In 1940, Stibitz
demonstrated the CNC at an American  Mathematical society conference held at Dartmouth College. Stibitz stunned the group 
by performing calculations remotely on the CNC using a teletype terminal connected via tol New York over special telephone

 10. 1982 - 	1982- Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and Internet Protocol(IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known
  as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This result is the fledging definition of the Internet as connected 
  TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the internet

- editorconfig The editorconfig file maintains consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
