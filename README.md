Barbara and Univesity of Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO", which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to
"LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the University. However the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system 
crashed 

4. 1972- BBN's Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The interworking Working groups(INWG) forms to address need for
