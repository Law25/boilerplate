1. 1940- Bell Telephone laboratories to complete this calculator  designed by scientist George Stibitz. In 1940, Stibitz
demonstrated the CNC at an American  Mathematical society conference held at Dartmouth College. Stibitz stunned the group 
by performing calculations remotely on the CNC using a teletype terminal connected via tol New York over special telephone

2. 1968- Beranek and Newman Inc(BBN) unveils the final version of the interface message producer(IMP) specifications' wins
ARPANET contract 

3.-1969- On Oct 29, UCLA'S Network Management center, Stanford research  institute(SRI), University of California-Santa 
Barbara and Univesity of Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO", which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to
"LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the University. However the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system 
crashed 

4. 1972- BBN's Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The interworking Working groups(INWG) forms to address need for 
establishing the SRI system crashed  
 
 5. 1973- Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London(England) nad Royal Radar Establishment(Norway)
 connect to ARPANET. The term internet is born
 
 6. 1974- The first Internet Service(ISP) is born with the introduction of a commerical version of ARPANET, known as 
 telnet
 -VIncton Cerf and Bobo Kahn(The duo said by mant to be the fathers of the internet, publish) "A protocol for Packet
 Network Interconnection", which details the design of TCP
 
 7.1976- Queen Elizabeth II hits the "send button" on her first email 
 
 8. 1979- USNET forms to host news and discussion groups 
 
 9. 1981- The National Science Foundation(NSF)provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network(CSNET) to 
 provide networking services to university computer scientistsThe National Science Foundation(NSF)provided a grant to 
 establish the Computer Science Network(CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists
 
 10. 1982 - 	1982- Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and Internet Protocol(IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known
  as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This result is the fledging definition of the Internet as connected 
  TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the internet

- editorconfig The editorconfig file maintains consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

- gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. Each line in gitattributes file is of form, when the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path. Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path.

- gitignore ,Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.A gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

- 404.html is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

- browserconfig.xml is used to define things like tile backgrounds, badge updates, and tile notifications. Browser configuration files let you set these images using external XML files rather than metadata within the HTML markup of a webpage

- favicon.ico is a small, iconic image that represents your website. Favicons are most often found in the address bar of your web browser, but they can also be used in lists of bookmarks in web browsers 
 
- human.txt It's a txt file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

- icon.png is based on pixels so you cant upscale without losing quailty so you have to pick the size you need but you can downsize

- index.html The index page is the URL or local file that automatically loads when a web browser starts and when the browser's 'home' button is pressed. The term is also used to refer to the front page, web server directory index, or main web page of a website of a group, company, organization, or individual.
Inside this file as I was reading the code I saw a couple lines that were commented out meaning they wont show once you run the code and Once I ran the code all it reads is Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate. Even though 21 lines through 23 were supposed to run a command it didnt the only command that ran was the print command leaveing the other commands I can only assume for us to comppleate in future assignments.

- robot.txt , is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned.

- site.manifest Removes "display": "standalone" from manifest

- tile-wide.png helps compress image's to a certain size

- tile.png converts the jpeg to 8-bit png and also minimize the storage size


# Tutorial
 
 - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

- Step 0: Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads and create a GitHub account at https://desktop.github.com/

- Github is  is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features

- Step 1: Create a repository by Go into the directory containing the project.
                                 Type git init .
                                 Type git add to add all of the relevant files.
                                 You'll probably want to create a .gitignore file right away, to indicate all of the files you don't want to track. Use  gitignore. And then hit commit.
                                 
- Clone, Cloning a git repository means that you create a local copy of the code provided by developer. You simply go on your github seek the project and hit clone then you go to your webstorm and paste it in and now you can access the files.

- Commit is a change to a file you can commit by looking at your screen on the top left hand corner and once you find the VCS click on it and look for the git tab and once opened the commit option will be there click on it and write a small message on what you are commiting.

- push what pushing does is  it refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. So once you commited follow the same steps VCS the Git and instead of clicking on commit the option under it will be push hit it and it will ask you what branch click on the one you want it to upload to to and wait to see if the push was successful.
