1. 1940- Bell Telephone laboratories to complete this calculator  designed by scientist George Stibitz. In 1940, Stibitz
demonstrated the CNC at an American  Mathematical society conference held at Dartmouth College. Stibitz stunned the group 
by performing calculations remotely on the CNC using a teletype terminal connected via tol New York over special telephone

2. 1968- Beranek and Newman Inc(BBN) unveils the final version of the interface message producer(IMP) specifications' wins
ARPANET contract 

3.-1969- On Oct 29, UCLA'S Network Management center, Stanford research  institute(SRI), University of California-Santa 
Barbara and University of Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO", which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to
"LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the University. However the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system 
crashed 

4. 1972- BBN's Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The interworking Working groups(INWG) forms to address need for

education networks, supported in parts of NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone- effectively expanding the internet
throughout the United States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that connected academic users along with
 the ARPANET

- editorconfig The editorconfig file maintains consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

- gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. Each line in gitattributes file is of form, when the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path. Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path.

- gitignore ,Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.A gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

- 404.html is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.

- browserconfig.xml is used to define things like tile backgrounds, badge updates, and tile notifications. Browser configuration files let you set these images using external XML files rather than metadata within the HTML markup of a webpage

- favicon.ico is a small, iconic image that represents your website. Favicons are most often found in the address bar of your web browser, but they can also be used in lists of bookmarks in web browsers 
 
- human.txt It's a txt file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

- icon.png is based on pixels so you cant upscale without losing quailty so you have to pick the size you need but you can downsize

- index.html The index page is the URL or local file that automatically loads when a web browser starts and when the browser's 'home' button is pressed. The term is also used to refer to the front page, web server directory index, or main web page of a website of a group, company, organization, or individual.
Inside this file as I was reading the code I saw a couple lines that were commented out meaning they wont show once you run the code and Once I ran the code all it reads is Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate. Even though 21 lines through 23 were supposed to run a command it didnt the only command that ran was the print command leaveing the other commands I can only assume for us to comppleate in future assignments.

- robot.txt , is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned.

- site.manifest Removes "display": "standalone" from manifest

- tile-wide.png helps compress image's to a certain size

- tile.png converts the jpeg to 8-bit png and also minimize the storage size


# Tutorial
 
 - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

- Step 0: Install git https://git-scm.com/downloads and create a GitHub account at https://desktop.github.com/

- Github is  is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features

- Step 1: Create a repository by Go into the directory containing the project.
                                 Type git init .
                                 Type git add to add all of the relevant files.
                                 You'll probably want to create a .gitignore file right away, to indicate all of the files you don't want to track. Use  gitignore. And then hit commit.
                                 
- Clone, Cloning a git repository means that you create a local copy of the code provided by developer. You simply go on your github seek the project and hit clone then you go to your webstorm and paste it in and now you can access the files.

- Commit is a change to a file you can commit by looking at your screen on the top left hand corner and once you find the VCS click on it and look for the git tab and once opened the commit option will be there click on it and write a small message on what you are committing.

- push what pushing does is  it refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository. So once you committed follow the same steps VCS the Git and instead of clicking on commit the option under it will be push hit it and it will ask you what branch click on the one you want it to upload to to and wait to see if the push was successful.

- pull : pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a 
pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow- up commits 
before your changes are merged into the base branch.

- Branch: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make you can merge your branch into the master branch to publish your changes.

- Merge: Merging takes the changes from one branch, and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request, or via the command line. A merge can automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can  always be done via the command line.

- Merge Conflict: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

- Fetch: Fetching refers to getting the latest change from an online repository without merging them in. Once these changes are fetch you can compare to your local branches.

- Remote: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote is stored on a code hosting service like GitHUb or an internal server
