# Timeline
- 
1. 1940- Bell Telephone laboratories to complete this calculator  designed by scientist George Stibitz. In 1940, Stibitz
demonstrated the CNC at an American  Mathematical society conference held at Dartmouth College. Stibitz stunned the group 
by performing calculations remotely on the CNC using a teletype terminal connected via tol New York over special telephone

2. 1968- Beranek and Newman Inc(BBN) unveils the final version of the interface message producer(IMP) specifications' wins
ARPANET contract 

3.-1969- On Oct 29, UCLA'S Network Management center, Stanford research  institute(SRI), University of California-Santa 
Barbara and Univesity of Utah install nodes. The first message is "LO", which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to
"LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the University. However the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system 
crashed 

4. 1972- BBN's Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The interworking Working groups(INWG) forms to address need for 
establishing the SRI system crashed  
 
 5. 1973- Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London(England) nad Royal Radar Establishment(Norway)
 connect to ARPANET. The term internet is born
 
 6. 1974- The first Internet Service(ISP) is born with the introduction of a commerical version of ARPANET, known as 
 telnet
 -VIncton Cerf and Bobo Kahn(The duo said by mant to be the fathers of the internet, publish) "A protocol for Packet
 Network Interconnection", which details the design of TCP
 
 7.1976- Queen Elizabeth II hits the "send button" on her first email 
 
 8. 1979- USNET forms to host news and discussion groups 
 
 9. 1981- The National Science Foundation(NSF)provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network(CSNET) to 
 provide networking services to university computer scientistsThe National Science Foundation(NSF)provided a grant to 
 establish the Computer Science Network(CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists
 
 10. 1982 - 	1982- Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and Internet Protocol(IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known
as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This result is the fledging definition of the Internet as connected 
TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the internet
  
 11. 1983- The Domain Name System(DNS) establishes the familiar .Edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org., .NET and .int system for
naming websites. This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.10

11. 1984- 	1984- William Gibson author of "Neuromancer', is the first to use the term "cyberspace"

12.	1985- Symbolics.com, the website for Symbolic Computer Corp. In Massachusetts, becomes the first registered domain

13. 1986 -	1986- The National Science Foundation's NSFNET goes online to connected supercomputer centers at 56,000 bits
per second- the speed of a typical dial-up computer modem. Over time the networks speeds up and regional research and 
education networks, supported in parts of NSF, are connected to the NSFNET backbone- effectively expanding the internet
throughout the United States. The NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that connected academic users along with
 the ARPANET
 
14. 1987- 	1987- The number of hosts on the internet exceeds 20,000. Cisco ships its first router
 
15. 1988- 	1988- World.std.com becomes the first commercial provider of dial-up access to the internet

16. 1990- 	1990- Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, develops 
Hypertext Markup Language(HTML). This technology continues to have a large impact on how we navigate and view the
internet today

17. 1991- 	1991- CERN introduces the World Wide Web to the public

18. 1992- 	1992- The first audio and video are distributed over the internet. The phrase "surfing the internet" is popularized

19. 1993- 	1993- The number of websites reached 600 and the White house and United Nations go online. Marc Andreessen
develops the Mosaic Web Browser at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. The number of computers connected to
NSFNET grows from 2,000 in 1985 to more than 2 million in 1993. The National Science foundation leads an effort to 
outline a new Internet architecture that would support the burgeoning commercial use of the network

20. 1994-Netscape Communications is bor. Microsoft created a Web Browser for Windows 95.
-Yahoo! Is created by Jerry Yang and David Filo, two electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University. 
The site originally called "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web." The company was later incorporated in March

21. 1995-CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy being to provide Internet access. Amazon.com, Craigslist's and eBay go 
live. The original NSFNET backbone to decommissioned as the Internet's transformation to a commercial enterprise is
 largely completed
 -The first online dating site, Match.com, launches
 
 22. 1996-The browser war, primarily between the two major players Microsoft and Netscape, heats up. CNET buys 
 tv.com for $15,000
 -A 3D animation dubbed "The Dancing Baby' becomes one of the first viral videos
